# 🚀 Quick Railway Deployment Guide

## 🚨 URGENT: Your Railway app is not running!

The current Railway URL `https://prompter-production.railway.app` is showing the default Railway page, which means your FastAPI backend is not deployed.

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIXES:

### 1. **Install Railway CLI**
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### 2. **Login to Railway**
```bash
railway login
```

### 3. **Deploy the Backend**
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/shri_jambhale/Desktop/prompter

# Initialize Railway project (if not already done)
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

### 4. **Get the New URL**
```bash
railway domain
```

### 5. **Update Extension Configuration**
Once you get the new URL, update these files:
- `chrome-extension/config.js`
- `chrome-extension/magical-enhancer.js` 
- `chrome-extension/popup.js`

## 📁 **Files Created for Deployment:**

✅ `railway.json` - Railway configuration
✅ `backend/railway.toml` - Backend-specific config
✅ `Procfile` - Process definition
✅ `deploy_to_railway.py` - Automated deployment script

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**

After deployment, your Railway URL should show:
```json
{
  "name": "Prompt Assistant API",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "status": "running",
  "endpoints": {
    "health": "/api/v1/health",
    "enhance": "/api/v1/enhance"
  }
}
```

## 🚀 **Quick Test:**

```bash
# Test the deployment
python deploy_to_railway.py
```

## ⚠️ **If Deployment Fails:**

1. Check Railway dashboard for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check logs: `railway logs`
4. Restart: `railway restart`

**The extension will work once the backend is properly deployed to Railway!**
