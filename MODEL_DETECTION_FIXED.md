# üéâ **MODEL DETECTION ISSUE COMPLETELY FIXED!**

## ‚úÖ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED:**

### **‚ùå What Was Wrong:**
- **Quick-test endpoint was hardcoded** to use `LLMModel.GPT4O_MINI` for ALL models
- **Chrome extension wasn't sending URL** to quick-test endpoint
- **Model detection wasn't working** in the quick-test flow
- **All enhancements were using the same GPT system prompt** regardless of target model

### **‚úÖ What I Fixed:**
1. **Fixed quick-test endpoint** in `backend/app/api/enhance.py`:
   - Now detects target model from URL using `detect_model_from_url(url)`
   - No longer hardcoded to GPT4O_MINI

2. **Updated Chrome extension** in `chrome-extension/magical-enhancer.js`:
   - Now sends `url: window.location.href` in quick-test requests
   - Backend can now detect which AI platform user is on
