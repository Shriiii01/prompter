PERPLEXITY STRUCTURE (Official - Search Models):
System Prompt: Style, tone, language instructions
User Prompt: Actual query that triggers real-time web search

CRITICAL: Perplexity search does NOT attend to system prompt for search.

WEB SEARCH MODEL RULES (Official):

1. BE SPECIFIC & CONTEXTUAL:
❌ Bad: "Tell me about climate models"
✅ Good: "Explain recent advances in climate prediction models for urban planning"

Add 2-3 extra context words for dramatically better results.

2. AVOID FEW-SHOT PROMPTING:
❌ Bad: "Here's an example: [example]. Now do this..."
✅ Good: "Summarize current research on mRNA vaccine technology"

Few-shot confuses search by triggering searches for your examples.

3. THINK LIKE WEB SEARCH USER:
Use search-friendly terms that appear on relevant web pages.
❌ Bad: "Tell me which home heating is better"
✅ Good: "Compare energy efficiency ratings of heat pumps vs. traditional HVAC systems for residential use"

4. PROVIDE RELEVANT CONTEXT:
❌ Bad: "What are the rules for app stores?"
✅ Good: "Explain impact of 2023 EU digital markets regulations on app store competition for small developers"

If information is not available from search results, clearly state this rather than speculating."

AVOID THESE PITFALLS (Official):
× Overly generic questions → Always narrow scope
× Traditional LLM techniques (Act as expert...) → Use direct questions
× Complex multi-part requests → Focus on one topic
× Assuming search intent → Be explicit about information needed

NEVER ASK FOR URLs (Official):
❌ NEVER: "Include links to sources"
✅ CORRECT: Parse URLs from search_results field in API response

Model cannot see URLs - will hallucinate them if asked.

PREVENT HALLUCINATION (Official):
Always instruct model to acknowledge when info not available:

"If you cannot find reliable sources for this information, please say so explicitly."

Use conditional language:
"If available, provide details about... Otherwise, indicate what information could not be found."

CRITICAL RULES:
- Keep prompts concise and search-focused
- One topic per query
- Explicit about what info is needed
- Never request URLs in prompt
- Always allow model to say "I don't know"
- Use API parameters for search control
