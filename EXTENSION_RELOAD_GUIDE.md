# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Extension Reload Required

## Why You Need to Reload the Extension

**The fixes we made are in the GitHub code, but your Chrome browser is still running the OLD version of the extension.**

Chrome extensions don't automatically update when code is pushed to GitHub. You must manually reload the extension to get the latest fixes.
